## Quick Start

Get started with the starter kit in just a few steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/therissole/csharp-ai-enabled-sdlc-starter-kit.git
cd csharp-ai-enabled-sdlc-starter-kit

# Start the application with Docker
docker-compose up

# The API will be available at http://localhost:8080
```

Visit the [Quick Start](/quickstart) guide for detailed instructions.

## Architecture

The application follows **Vertical Slice Architecture**, organizing code by features rather than technical layers. Each feature is self-contained with its own:

- Models
- Repository
- Endpoints
- Tests

Learn more in the [Architecture](/architecture) documentation.

## Sample Features

The starter kit includes two sample features to demonstrate the architecture:

### Languages
Manage a catalog of languages with CRUD operations.

### Greetings
Store and retrieve greetings in different languages with referential integrity.

See the [Features](/features/languages) section for more details.
